 *
 * @note   Direction of the motor rotation is calculated using two consecutive states of HALL sensors.
 *		   Every toggling of XOR combination triggers a DMA transfer of the GPIOA pins state. Combinational logic function deduct the rotation direction.
 *		   This solution is the most faithful to reality but comes with a drawback: the calculation of direction may falsify the speed value due to errors.
 *		   A first order low pass filter is implemented to correct this issue, but higher order is needed.
 *
 * @note   Motor control value is used to stop computing rotation direction while braking. It helps improving the result since direction won't change if control is null.
